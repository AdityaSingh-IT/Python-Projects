# Supply Chain Analysis: Optimizing Operations for a Fashion & Beauty Startup 📊

## 📄 Overview

This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive **Supply Chain Analysis** using a dataset from a **Fashion and Beauty startup**. The primary goal is to leverage data science techniques to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) across the supply chain—from production to customer delivery—to identify inefficiencies, minimize costs, and inform data-driven operational strategy.

The analysis is performed using Python, primarily leveraging libraries such as **Pandas** for data manipulation and potentially **Matplotlib/Seaborn/Plotly** for visualization (standard for Kaggle notebooks).

## 🗃️ Data Summary

The analysis utilizes the `supply_chain_data.csv` dataset, which contains 100 entries and 24 features detailing product, logistics, and cost information.

| Feature Category | Example Columns |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Product & Sales** | Product type, SKU, Price, Number of products sold, Revenue generated |
| **Inventory & Time** | Stock levels, Lead times, Order quantities, Shipping times |
| **Costs & Logistics** | Shipping costs, Supplier name, Location, Manufacturing costs, Transportation modes, Costs |
| **Quality** | Inspection results, Defect rates |

## 🚀 Key Analysis Areas

The notebook explores the following critical aspects of the supply chain:

1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Initial cleaning, descriptive statistics, and data visualization.
2.  **Product & Revenue Analysis:** Relationship between product price and revenue generated, and sales distribution across product categories.
3.  **Lead Time & Manufacturing Cost Analysis:** Comparison of average lead times and manufacturing costs categorized by product type.
4.  **Logistics & Carrier Performance:** Evaluation of revenue generated by different shipping carriers and cost distribution by transportation mode (Road, Rail, Air, Sea).
5.  **Quality Control & Defect Analysis:** Examination of defect rates across various product types and transportation modes to pinpoint quality risks.

## 🎯 Quantified Key Insights

* **Revenue Drivers:** **Skincare** products are the most significant source of revenue, accounting for approximately **45%** of the business. The analysis suggests that consumers associate higher prices with higher quality in the skincare segment.
* **Logistics Efficiency:** **Carrier B** contributes the highest revenue but is also identified as the **costliest** carrier, highlighting a trade-off between speed/reliability and operating expense.
* **Quality Risk:** **Road transportation** results in the highest recorded **defect rate**, while **Air transportation** shows the lowest, indicating a need to reassess product handling procedures for ground transit.
* **Cost Management:** Significant spending is allocated to **Road and Rail** modes of transportation, warranting a deeper cost-benefit analysis of these routes versus air or sea freight options.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* `Python`
* `Pandas` (Data manipulation)
* `Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly` (Data visualization)
* `NumPy` (Numerical operations)
